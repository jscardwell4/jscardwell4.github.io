				"content_html": "<p><img style=\"display:none;\" src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/129d9a2c55.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>While looking through old photos I came across these assets for an application I did a while ago. I thought it might be fun to write a guide on how one might go about throwing a whole lot of work at something and never actually finish it. The name I gave this application was Perpetual Groove, and the first thing on the agenda is to go nuts creating an icon for it.</p>\n\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/129d9a2c55.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"perpetual-groove\"\n   \n   \n>\n<img src= \"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/129d9a2c55.jpg\"\n        \n        \n   style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n    </p>\n\n<p>Next, ponder the scale of your project. It should clearly be bigger than any one person should consider. Maintaining your application should not be a consideration.</p>\n\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/1a0786659d.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"perpetual-groove\"\n   \n   \n>\n<img src= \"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/1a0786659d.jpg\"\n        \n        \n   style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n    </p>\n\n<p>Now, waste a shit ton of time on icons. I mean … don&rsquo;t worry that all that detail is undetectable at application scale.</p>\n\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/38013dd658.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"perpetual-groove\"\n   \n   \n>\n<img src= \"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/38013dd658.jpg\"\n        \n        \n   style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n    </p>\n\n<p>Once the basics have been established, we can begin adding complicated and unnecessary functionality such as MIDI file import and export capability, a transport complete with jog dial, and full editing capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/ff1acf28db.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"perpetual-groove\"\n   \n   \n>\n<img src= \"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/ff1acf28db.jpg\"\n        \n        \n   style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n    </p>\n\n<p>And if you are parsing MIDI files … just build the parser yourself. Hex code is fun, right?</p>\n\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/adbcce854e.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"perpetual-groove\"\n   \n   \n>\n<img src= \"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/adbcce854e.jpg\"\n        \n        \n   style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n    </p>\n\n<p>Definitely support both portrait and landscape.

Moving on. Now that your application is practically out the f$&amp;king door, this is the perfect time to relocate. This will give you 2-4 weeks away from the project entirely. The goal here, of course, is to lose track of all that unnecessary complexity you have thrown into your application.</p>\n\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/db18bad58a.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"perpetual-groove\"\n   \n   \n>\n<img src= \"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/db18bad58a.jpg\"\n        \n        \n   style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n    </p>\n\n<p>But let&rsquo;s stick with the previous screenshot. Did anybody notice the appearance of still more icons in the editor? You never want to stop injecting unnecessary complexity into your application</p>\n\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/fdcfd17cd4.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"perpetual-groove\"\n   \n   \n>\n<img src= \"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/fdcfd17cd4.jpg\"\n        \n        \n   style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n    </p>\n\n<p>Once relocated and finished unpacking, revisit your application. Notice how all that complexity leaves you with no real feel for where you were or how to jump back in. The perfect time to start a new project, am I right?</p>\n\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/8538e135ac.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"perpetual-groove\"\n   \n   \n>\n<img src= \"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/8538e135ac.jpg\"\n        \n        \n   style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n    </p>\n\n<p>And if anyone takes an interest in this guide, I will make another for Chord Finder.

I thought it might be fun to write a guide on how one might go about throwing a whole lot of work at something and never actually finish it. The name I gave this application was Perpetual Groove, and the first thing on the agenda is to go nuts creating an icon for it.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/129d9a2c55.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nNext, ponder the scale of your project. It should clearly be bigger than any one person should consider. Maintaining your application should not be a consideration.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/1a0786659d.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nNow, waste a shit ton of time on icons. I mean … don't worry that all that detail is undetectable at application scale.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/38013dd658.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nOnce the basics have been established, we can begin adding complicated and unnecessary functionality such as MIDI file import and export capability, a transport complete with jog dial, and full editing capabilities.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/ff1acf28db.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nAnd if you are parsing MIDI files … just build the parser yourself. Hex code is fun, right?\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/adbcce854e.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nDefinitely support both portrait and landscape. So necessary.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/7e0282e0ce.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nGo f$&king bonkers on the notes while working out the geometry.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/8cc196737f.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/9742d0501a.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n</p>\n\nAnd be sure to get extra fancy when considering animations.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/49db1bf4dd.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/798772464f.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n</p>\n\nLike, wouldn't it be cool if the horizontal scrolling felt three dimensional? Make that sh$t happen.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/7d85c78fe8.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/f5053211eb.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n</p>\n\nDid I already mention the notes?\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/6751c96497.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/dfd4d86f91.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n</p>\n\nOkay, good. Moving on. Now that your application is practically out the f$&king door, this is the perfect time to relocate. This will give you 2-4 weeks away from the project entirely. The goal here, of course, is to lose track of all that unnecessary complexity you have thrown into your application.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/db18bad58a.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nBut let's stick with the previous screenshot. Did anybody notice the appearance of still more icons in the editor? You never want to stop injecting unnecessary complexity into your application\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/fdcfd17cd4.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nOnce relocated and finished unpacking, revisit your application. Notice how all that complexity leaves you with no real feel for where you were or how to jump back in. The perfect time to start a new project, am I right?\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/8538e135ac.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nAnd if anyone takes an interest in this guide, I will make another for Chord Finder. The complexity only goes up folks. We are talking signal processing, neural networks, low level graphics, Swift frameworks that are themselves wrappers for C++ frameworks, etc., etc.\n",

F$&amp;k that sh$t … he is the bullsh$t babbling baboon puffed up like an orange balloon that we all clearly see him to be. Trump is the f$&amp;king tool. His enablers built the propaganda machine for peddling this cult of personality as a means for safeguarding their minority rule over our nation.</p>\n\n<p>I am not quite sure how we are meant to judge psychopathy where accountability is concerned, I can’t quite put my finger on a true psychopath’s capacity for comprehension. I have no such knowledge gaps when it comes to non-psychopaths utilizing weaponized psychopathy to achieve a stranglehold on power … willingly committing treason to protect that which they have gained.</p>\n\n<p>The constitution had an answer for Trump. Enablers … such as Lindsey Graham …\npublicly parted ways with any pretense of public service … liquidated their constitutional oathes when the Senate chamber was recast as a kangaroo court. They chose subversion.</p>\n\n<p>When COVID broke like a rogue wave across this nation … they once again saw an opportunity to embrace the contemptible whilst scrambling to shore up their dwindling authority. These enablers sought to utilize the disruptive chaos produced by a plagued nation to amplify their efforts at disenfranchisement.</p>\n\n<p>How pleased must they have been upon learning that the virus was disproportionately killing more brown and black Americans than it was killing white Americans.

				"content_text": "Everyone keeps acting like Trump is a f$&king mob boss controlling those around him. F$&k that sh$t … he is the bullsh$t babbling baboon puffed up like an orange balloon that we all clearly see him to be. Trump is the f$&king tool. His enablers built the propaganda machine for peddling this cult of personality as a means for safeguarding their minority rule over our nation. \n\nI am not quite sure how we are meant to judge psychopathy where accountability is concerned, I can’t quite put my finger on a true psychopath’s capacity for comprehension. I have no such knowledge gaps when it comes to non-psychopaths utilizing weaponized psychopathy to achieve a stranglehold on power … willingly committing treason to protect that which they have gained.\n\nThe constitution had an answer for Trump. Enablers … such as Lindsey Graham …\npublicly parted ways with any pretense of public service … liquidated their constitutional oathes when the Senate chamber was recast as a kangaroo court. They chose subversion.\n\nWhen COVID broke like a rogue wave across this nation … they once again saw an opportunity to embrace the contemptible whilst scrambling to shore up their dwindling authority. These enablers sought to utilize the disruptive chaos produced by a plagued nation to amplify their efforts at disenfranchisement.\n\nHow pleased must they have been upon learning that the virus was disproportionately killing more brown and black Americans than it was killing white Americans. The virus … itself … became a tool. Those we speak of as minorities in this nation … those who when we add them together shall soon become a majority … they were the ones in the eye of the storm.\n\nWhat perhaps began as a political stance born of stupidity or stubbornness or something else entirely … had blossomed into fresh opportunity … an opportunity for our  elderly white ruling class to roll back the color-to-white ratio of our populace … herd immunity very quickly became the official federal COVID response … tapping Atlas simply emboldened them to tell us so.\n\nLindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell, Bill Barr, every GD GOP senator, every f$&king GOP member that has openly embraced these actions … or whose solidarity is shown through silence … these are the responsible parties.
