				"title": "On Dragons",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/6eb2245d1b.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>A brief note for short attention spans: stick around if you wanna see how I manage to seamlessly (and I do say so myself) tie together dragon mytholygy, weaving, and politics into one giant point about worldview diversity and problem solving efficacy (even got a Trumpian meme for y&rsquo;all towards the bottom if that is more your bag).</em></p>\n\n<p>I have always been fascinated by the common thread stretched about humanity that links up our narratives. The similitude with which humanity engineers itself by independent means.</p>\n\n<p>Take dragons for example. Damn near everyone thought up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon\">dragons</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/00d5da3d1c.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>They thought ‘em up in Egypt, where <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apep\">Apep</a> was the very embodiment of chaos.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/47a0bea281.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Egypt also thought up my personal favorite, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros\">Ouroboros</a>, who was a manifestation of the snake god <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehen\">Mehen</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/874a97640b.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>They thought ‘em up in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_dragon\">Mother Russia</a>  where it would appear three really <strong>is</strong> a magic number. One would assume their mastery of weather and water source got ‘em the gig at the bow of this Russian Viking ship.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/9f2a003bad.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>This handsome three-headed fella, who goes by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zmei_(Russian)\">Zmey Gorynych</a>, is from Russian folklore. He liked taking human form and seducing him some laadiees.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/a0b4221bdf.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragons_in_Greek_mythology\">Greece</a>, dragons were hurling up namesakes. Here we see a depiction of Athena watching as the Colchian dragon, guardian of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece\">Golden Fleece</a>, disgorges <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason\">Jason</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/b4842595e5.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Greek dragons were also being raised solely for the purpose of slaying <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles\">Heracles</a> (pictured here failing miserably is the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra\">Lernaean Hydra</a>).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/95fafaaddc.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Greeks also liked stickin‘ ‘em in mosaics, as with this depiction of a sea dragon or <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus_(mythology)\">cetus</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/2506911b09.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon\">China</a>, where dragons were thought to bring good luck to those worthy of such fortune, you’ll find them carved into walls. I mean … be kinda awkward <strong>not</strong> to find dragons at <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-Dragon_Wall\">Nine-Dragon Wall</a> … am I right?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/f2ffa32f21.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The last imperial dynasty of China, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty\">Qing</a> dynasty, chose to stick one of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_King\">dragon gods</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Dragon\">Azure Dragon</a>, on their <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Qing_dynasty\">flag</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/8c79c15465.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>It wouldn’t be long before the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon\">Chinese dragon</a> would make its way to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dragon\">Japan</a>, as evidenced by this <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai\">Hokusai</a> painting,</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/2b93615a1a.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>as well as to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_dragon\">Korea</a>, as evidenced by the murals found at the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goguryeo_tombs\">Goguryeo tombs</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/c78e135d17.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The first known portrayal of a fully modern, western dragon may be found within a <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=8798&amp;CollID=8&amp;NStart=3244\">medieval manuscript</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/7746050ebd.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Native Americans painted dragons on bluffs. This fearsome <a href=\"http://www.altonweb.com/history/piasabird/\">piasa bird</a> craved human flesh.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/fffcb485eb.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>So what is the point of my little <em>dragons of the world</em> presentation? I believe it worth considering the discrepancies and commonalities amongst such cultural invention.</p>\n\n<p>Let us begin with commonalities. The nearest I can tell, the single common thread among these narratives defines a dragon as a <em>serpentine, legendary creature</em>. Let me paint my point metaphorically.</p>\n\n<p>We often speak of storytellers as though they were spinning yarn.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2021/6eb2245d1b.jpg\" />\n\n*A brief note for short attention spans: stick around if you wanna see how I manage to seamlessly (and I do say so myself) tie together dragon mytholygy, weaving, and politics into one giant point about worldview diversity and problem solving efficacy (even got a Trumpian meme for y'all towards the bottom if that is more your bag).*\n\nI have always been fascinated by the common thread stretched about humanity that links up our narratives. The similitude with which humanity engineers itself by independent means.\n\nTake dragons for example. Damn near everyone thought up [dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon).\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/00d5da3d1c.jpg\" />\n\nThey thought ‘em up in Egypt, where [Apep](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apep) was the very embodiment of chaos.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/47a0bea281.jpg\" />\n\nEgypt also thought up my personal favorite, [Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros), who was a manifestation of the snake god [Mehen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehen).\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/874a97640b.jpg\" />\n\nThey thought ‘em up in [Mother Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_dragon)  where it would appear three really **is** a magic number. One would assume their mastery of weather and water source got ‘em the gig at the bow of this Russian Viking ship.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/9f2a003bad.jpg\" />\n\nThis handsome three-headed fella, who goes by [Zmey Gorynych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zmei_(Russian)), is from Russian folklore. He liked taking human form and seducing him some laadiees.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/a0b4221bdf.jpg\" />\n\nIn [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragons_in_Greek_mythology), dragons were hurling up namesakes. Here we see a depiction of Athena watching as the Colchian dragon, guardian of the [Golden Fleece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece), disgorges [Jason](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason).\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/b4842595e5.jpg\" />\n\nGreek dragons were also being raised solely for the purpose of slaying [Heracles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles) (pictured here failing miserably is the [Lernaean Hydra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra)).\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/95fafaaddc.jpg\" />\n\nThe Greeks also liked stickin‘ ‘em in mosaics, as with this depiction of a sea dragon or [cetus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus_(mythology)). \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/2506911b09.jpg\" />\n\nIn [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon), where dragons were thought to bring good luck to those worthy of such fortune, you’ll find them carved into walls. I mean … be kinda awkward **not** to find dragons at [Nine-Dragon Wall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-Dragon_Wall) … am I right?\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/f2ffa32f21.jpg\" />\n\nThe last imperial dynasty of China, the [Qing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty) dynasty, chose to stick one of the [dragon gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_King), the [Azure Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Dragon), on their [flag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Qing_dynasty).\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/8c79c15465.jpg\" />\n\nIt wouldn’t be long before the [Chinese dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon) would make its way to [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dragon), as evidenced by this [Hokusai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai) painting,\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/2b93615a1a.jpg\" />\n\nas well as to [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_dragon), as evidenced by the murals found at the [Goguryeo tombs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goguryeo_tombs).\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/c78e135d17.jpg\" />\n\nThe first known portrayal of a fully modern, western dragon may be found within a [medieval manuscript](https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=8798&CollID=8&NStart=3244).\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/7746050ebd.jpg\" />\n\nNative Americans painted dragons on bluffs. This fearsome [piasa bird](http://www.altonweb.com/history/piasabird/) craved human flesh.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/fffcb485eb.jpg\" />\n\nSo what is the point of my little *dragons of the world* presentation? I believe it worth considering the discrepancies and commonalities amongst such cultural invention. \n\nLet us begin with commonalities. The nearest I can tell, the single common thread among these narratives defines a dragon as a *serpentine, legendary creature*. Let me paint my point metaphorically.\n\nWe often speak of storytellers as though they were spinning yarn. It would not, then, be much of a stretch to reimagine them as weavers, and their creations as tapestries such as the two below.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/66e2fd16b3.jpg\" />\n\nWe might think of the universally common as the [warp](https://rebeccamezoff.com/blog/2018/3/14/warp-and-weft-a-cooperative-relationship-in-tapestry-weaving) threads running through these tapestries. Something structural. Not the good stuff.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/6a007830d0.jpg\" />\n\nWhat they all saw the same way isn't really the interesting bit, is it? Seems to me the good stuff is what each culture thought of a little bit differently, the [weft](https://rebeccamezoff.com/blog/2018/3/14/warp-and-weft-a-cooperative-relationship-in-tapestry-weaving) threads of the tapestries. \n\nThat which makes the Chinese dragon on the right something entirely different than the Celtic dragon on the left. Different … but no less beautiful … and the world is richer having known them both. Having known them both, what might one weave next?\n\nConsider, then, what invention becomes possible with all things considered.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/298b580c46.jpg\" />\n\nWhat might I be able to learn from someone with whom I share nothing but [warp](https://rebeccamezoff.com/blog/2018/3/14/warp-and-weft-a-cooperative-relationship-in-tapestry-weaving) threads (were we each provided our very own [babel fish](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Babel_Fish)  … obviously).\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/59606bb423.jpg\" />\n\nWhat might he learn from me? After we have finished feeding our fish and gone our separate ways, how might we be affected? What ingenuity might we have unlocked for future endeavors?\n\nNot enough? Not yet convinced of the beneficiality of discrepant embrace? Another example, then. \n\nWhat must this untouched Amazonian tribe have thought possible that they hadn’t only moments earlier?\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/efe58bb8a3.jpg\" />\n\nI don’t want y’all thinkin’ I *only* value discrepancy. We value the shared human experience, that which binds us as a species … the things about our lives, about the human condition, one finds to be as true beneath the canopy as they are in my backyard.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/5161968f3c.jpg\" />\n\nWithout such [warp](https://rebeccamezoff.com/blog/2018/3/14/warp-and-weft-a-cooperative-relationship-in-tapestry-weaving) threads we might find those outside the purview of our particular worldview entirely unrelatable.

This last cycle, they failed to produce even a modicum of effort. They would not even gather what they were offering into words in some official party platform. They were not offering anything.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of pitching <strong>we the people</strong> on why they deserve to retain power, they embraced the most vile forms of weaponized propaganda. They embraced fascism and  white nationalism. They embraced a cult to which approximately twenty-two million of our fellow Americans have fallen victim. They embraced immortality by way of drinking up babies whilst wearing little girl faces.</p>\n\n<p>They knew they could not grow their base with such f$&amp;kery, so they looked to abuse the court circuits they spent four years stacking (ask yourself why they deemed this necessary if not to extend their capability to hold minority rule over the American people).</p>\n\n<p>This is an inflection point in our history because the very heart of American identity, the ideals we have spent centuries touting, the documents with which our nation&rsquo;s forefathers have for so long guided the hand of governance … all of these have become vulnerable. In Trump this nation elected a president that would test every “oh shit” button our forefathers installed. For the first time in my lifetime, I was prepared to go to war for my country.</p>\n\n<p>As Obama surmised while eulogizing the great John Lewis, I felt I could no longer accept freedom for myself while witnessing the subjugation of my fellow Americans. The narrowness of our escape from this trajectory is impossible to over exaggerate.</p>\n\n<p>We endured four years of Trumpism, four years of learning just how powerful a weapon is the bifurcated bubble. Isolate. Pump in propaganda. Pray on worldview rigidity. Pray on those susceptible to cult phenomena. Do this and one may absolutely normalize the absence of accountability at the highest level.</p>\n\n<p>All but a handful within the Republican party were hoping the insurrection would succeed. They were hoping they would retain power. They were hoping they would retain minority rule over this great nation.</p>\n\n<p>For a brief moment, minority rule has ended. <strong>We the people</strong> have returned legislative power to the party that believes in civil service. There is, however, something of grave importance we must consider. The governmental imprint Trump leaves behind will sound as a death knell for American democracy should the current administration fail to rake the sand.</p>\n\n<p>Should they choose, however, to pick up the reigns and lead, it may be possible for <strong>we the people</strong> to return to some lesser level of political engagement. Not disengaged, but not dominated by the engagement.</p>\n\n<p>Senator Joe Manchin, if the Democratic party fails to invest their courage in their convictions, if they fail to lead out of fear of being primaried, if they tank good policy to brush back the red … <strong>we the people</strong> will be called upon once more to safeguard this nation against minority rule.</p>\n\n<p>As arduous a task safeguarding against minority rule may be, merging our dualing reality information ecosystems is the more difficult task.</p>\n\n<p>Senator Joe Manchin, the Democratic party must embrace the power <strong>we the people</strong> have bestowed upon them. The power we have bestowed upon them in order to restore a people’s freedoms. The power we have bestowed upon them to hold accountable those that have assaulted our democracy, those <a href=\"https://moondeer.micro.blog/2020/11/24/on-accountability.html\">vampiric vultures</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Senator Joe Manchin, and any other Democrat who happens to be cut of similar cloth, you will do the job <strong>we the people</strong>  have asked you to do, or we … the people … will replace you with someone who will.</p>\n",

They were not offering anything.\n\nInstead of pitching **we the people** on why they deserve to retain power, they embraced the most vile forms of weaponized propaganda. They embraced fascism and  white nationalism. They embraced a cult to which approximately twenty-two million of our fellow Americans have fallen victim. They embraced immortality by way of drinking up babies whilst wearing little girl faces.\n\nThey knew they could not grow their base with such f$&kery, so they looked to abuse the court circuits they spent four years stacking (ask yourself why they deemed this necessary if not to extend their capability to hold minority rule over the American people).\n\nThis is an inflection point in our history because the very heart of American identity, the ideals we have spent centuries touting, the documents with which our nation's forefathers have for so long guided the hand of governance … all of these have become vulnerable. In Trump this nation elected a president that would test every “oh shit” button our forefathers installed. For the first time in my lifetime, I was prepared to go to war for my country.\n\nAs Obama surmised while eulogizing the great John Lewis, I felt I could no longer accept freedom for myself while witnessing the subjugation of my fellow Americans. The narrowness of our escape from this trajectory is impossible to over exaggerate.\n\nWe endured four years of Trumpism, four years of learning just how powerful a weapon is the bifurcated bubble. Isolate. Pump in propaganda. Pray on worldview rigidity. Pray on those susceptible to cult phenomena. Do this and one may absolutely normalize the absence of accountability at the highest level.\n\nAll but a handful within the Republican party were hoping the insurrection would succeed. They were hoping they would retain power. They were hoping they would retain minority rule over this great nation.\n\nFor a brief moment, minority rule has ended. **We the people** have returned legislative power to the party that believes in civil service. There is, however, something of grave importance we must consider. The governmental imprint Trump leaves behind will sound as a death knell for American democracy should the current administration fail to rake the sand. \n\nShould they choose, however, to pick up the reigns and lead, it may be possible for **we the people** to return to some lesser level of political engagement. Not disengaged, but not dominated by the engagement. \n\nSenator Joe Manchin, if the Democratic party fails to invest their courage in their convictions, if they fail to lead out of fear of being primaried, if they tank good policy to brush back the red … **we the people** will be called upon once more to safeguard this nation against minority rule. \n\nAs arduous a task safeguarding against minority rule may be, merging our dualing reality information ecosystems is the more difficult task.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin, the Democratic party must embrace the power **we the people** have bestowed upon them. The power we have bestowed upon them in order to restore a people’s freedoms. The power we have bestowed upon them to hold accountable those that have assaulted our democracy, those [vampiric vultures](https://moondeer.micro.blog/2020/11/24/on-accountability.html).\n\nSenator Joe Manchin, and any other Democrat who happens to be cut of similar cloth, you will do the job **we the people**  have asked you to do, or we … the people … will replace you with someone who will.\n",

Moving on. Now that your application is practically out the f$&amp;king door, this is the perfect time to relocate. This will give you 2-4 weeks away from the project entirely. The goal here, of course, is to lose track of all that unnecessary complexity you have thrown into your application.</p>\n\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/db18bad58a.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"perpetual-groove\"\n   \n   \n>\n<img src= \"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/db18bad58a.jpg\"\n        \n        \n   style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n    </p>\n\n<p>But let&rsquo;s stick with the previous screenshot. Did anybody notice the appearance of still more icons in the editor? You never want to stop injecting unnecessary complexity into your application</p>\n\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/fdcfd17cd4.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"perpetual-groove\"\n   \n   \n>\n<img src= \"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/fdcfd17cd4.jpg\"\n        \n        \n   style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n    </p>\n\n<p>Once relocated and finished unpacking, revisit your application. Notice how all that complexity leaves you with no real feel for where you were or how to jump back in. The perfect time to start a new project, am I right?</p>\n\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/8538e135ac.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"perpetual-groove\"\n   \n   \n>\n<img src= \"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/8538e135ac.jpg\"\n        \n        \n   style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n    </p>\n\n<p>And if anyone takes an interest in this guide, I will make another for Chord Finder. The complexity only goes up folks. We are talking signal processing, neural networks, low level graphics, Swift frameworks that are themselves wrappers for C++ frameworks, etc., etc.</p>\n",

Maintaining your application should not be a consideration.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/1a0786659d.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nNow, waste a shit ton of time on icons. I mean … don't worry that all that detail is undetectable at application scale.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/38013dd658.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nOnce the basics have been established, we can begin adding complicated and unnecessary functionality such as MIDI file import and export capability, a transport complete with jog dial, and full editing capabilities.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/ff1acf28db.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nAnd if you are parsing MIDI files … just build the parser yourself. Hex code is fun, right?\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/adbcce854e.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nDefinitely support both portrait and landscape. So necessary.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/7e0282e0ce.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nGo f$&king bonkers on the notes while working out the geometry.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/8cc196737f.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/9742d0501a.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n</p>\n\nAnd be sure to get extra fancy when considering animations.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/49db1bf4dd.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/798772464f.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n</p>\n\nLike, wouldn't it be cool if the horizontal scrolling felt three dimensional? Make that sh$t happen.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/7d85c78fe8.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/f5053211eb.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n</p>\n\nDid I already mention the notes?\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/6751c96497.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/dfd4d86f91.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n</p>\n\nOkay, good. Moving on. Now that your application is practically out the f$&king door, this is the perfect time to relocate. This will give you 2-4 weeks away from the project entirely. The goal here, of course, is to lose track of all that unnecessary complexity you have thrown into your application.\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/db18bad58a.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nBut let's stick with the previous screenshot. Did anybody notice the appearance of still more icons in the editor? You never want to stop injecting unnecessary complexity into your application\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/fdcfd17cd4.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nOnce relocated and finished unpacking, revisit your application. Notice how all that complexity leaves you with no real feel for where you were or how to jump back in. The perfect time to start a new project, am I right?\n\n<p>\n\t{{<glightbox src=\"https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/8538e135ac.jpg\" gallery=\"perpetual-groove\" >}}\n\t</p>\n\nAnd if anyone takes an interest in this guide, I will make another for Chord Finder. The complexity only goes up folks. We are talking signal processing, neural networks, low level graphics, Swift frameworks that are themselves wrappers for C++ frameworks, etc., etc.\n",
