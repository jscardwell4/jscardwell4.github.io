Anyone wondering with which chord pattern Rachel Maddow was primarily speaking during last night&rsquo;s broadcast may now consider their curiosity quenched. The chord pattern with which she seems to enjoy projecting her prose would clearly be that of 9♮11(♭13).</p>

<p>Some spectrum visualizations and top five most likely candidate lists for a couple of the neural network projections.</p>

<p>While looking through old photos I came across these assets for an application I did a while ago. I thought it might be fun to write a guide on how one might go about throwing a whole lot of work at something and never actually finish it. The name I gave this application was Perpetual Groove, and the first thing on the agenda is to go nuts creating an icon for it.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/129d9a2c55.jpg"

   style="max-width: 100%"/>
</a>

    </p>

<p>Next, ponder the scale of your project. It should clearly be bigger than any one person should consider. Maintaining your application should not be a consideration.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/1a0786659d.jpg" 
   class="glightbox"

   style="max-width: 100%"/>
</a>

    </p>

<p>Now, waste a shit ton of time on icons. I mean … don&rsquo;t worry that all that detail is undetectable at application scale.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/38013dd658.jpg"

   style="max-width: 100%"/>
</a>

    </p>

<p>Once the basics have been established, we can begin adding complicated and unnecessary functionality such as MIDI file import and export capability, a transport complete with jog dial, and full editing capabilities.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/ff1acf28db.jpg"

   style="max-width: 100%"/>
</a>

    </p>

<p>And if you are parsing MIDI files … just build the parser yourself. Hex code is fun, right?</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/adbcce854e.jpg"

    </p>

<p>Definitely support both portrait and landscape. So necessary.</p>

<p>Okay, good. Moving on. Now that your application is practically out the f$&amp;king door, this is the perfect time to relocate. This will give you 2-4 weeks away from the project entirely. The goal here, of course, is to lose track of all that unnecessary complexity you have thrown into your application.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/db18bad58a.jpg" 
   class="glightbox"

   style="max-width: 100%"/>
</a>

    </p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s stick with the previous screenshot. Did anybody notice the appearance of still more icons in the editor? You never want to stop injecting unnecessary complexity into your application</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/fdcfd17cd4.jpg" 
   class="glightbox"

   style="max-width: 100%"/>
</a>

    </p>

<p>Once relocated and finished unpacking, revisit your application. Notice how all that complexity leaves you with no real feel for where you were or how to jump back in. The perfect time to start a new project, am I right?</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://Moondeer.micro.blog/uploads/2020/8538e135ac.jpg"

</a>

    </p>

<p>And if anyone takes an interest in this guide, I will make another for Chord Finder. The complexity only goes up folks. We are talking signal processing, neural networks, low level graphics, Swift frameworks that are themselves wrappers for C++ frameworks, etc., etc.</p>

<p>This is the moment. This is the mother… f$&amp;king… moment. The moment when the momentum shifts, when the forming of a more perfect union, a true multicultural democracy for the land of the free, becomes measurably closer to inevitable than it is to unfathomable.</p>

<p>I need this. I mean I f$&amp;king NEED this. My home state, the state that made me, the state of Georgia, needs this. Our entire country needs this. The whole… f$&amp;king… world… NEEDS… THIS! So let’s get to work. Let’s make it happen.</p>

So let&rsquo;s have a closer look at what lies within these bewitching bubbles.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the first bubble. Here you&rsquo;ll find such familiar factions as all-of-the-f$&amp;king-left and the NeverTrumpers. With these two resident groups, bubble one is unique in housing a complete representation of our nation&rsquo;s traditional two party system. This, predictably, generates much discord; however, you&rsquo;ll find all bubble one denizens united behind a globule cause: the restoration of observable reality as a basis for civil discourse.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move to the second bubble. Here you’ll also find some familiar factions like the GOP and the KKK. To fully comprehend the complexity of bubble two denizens; however, we must familarize ourselves with some relatively new additions. Are you a white nationalist eagerly awaiting the commencement of your race war, fearing that an evolving American demography might minoritize you? Then perhaps you are already acquainted with the Proud Bois. Pizzagate got you down? Perhaps Q is not new to you. As with bubble one, we may tease out a characteristic universally applicable to bubble two denizens: the uncanny ability to house diometrically opposing viewpoints within their skulls. Tragically, this trait leaves bubble two residents tremendously susceptible to both propaganda and cult phenomena.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s consider what the two bubbles have in common. Within each of these bubbles something magical happens. An entire reality blossoms within each bubble. An existence so colorfully complete that bubble residents begin to believe that their bubble must hold all of existence. Spend enough time within a bubble&rsquo;s confines and any memory of a greater reality, of a world outside of the bubble, fades away like the colors of a weathered &ldquo;these colors don&rsquo;t run&rdquo; bumpersticker.</p>

<p>If we conduct a direct comparison between the two bubble realities, you’ll notice that they diverge in some fascinating ways. Take the first bubble. Within this bubble it is a widely held belief that our norms and our precedents alone can protect our democracy. Naive, I know, but bless their hearts. Bubble two, in contrast, believes these same norms and precedents to be the insidious tools used by agents of the deep state as they work towards democracy&rsquo;s deconstruction. And check this out. In the second bubble … and seriously you won’t want to believe me but I promise you this is true … in this second bubble millions … yes millions … of people find it totally plausible for their to be a shadowy, high power cabal drinking up babies in pursuit of immortality. Suffice it to say that among the myriad of bubble one denizen concerns you&rsquo;ll not find any mention of baby drinking.</p>

<p>Now ask yourself why such disparities between bubble realities? Cult phenomena can be tricky so don’t feel bad if you can’t think of the answer. I can’t think of it myself. What greater implications might we find concerning the bifurcation of our information ecosystem? How would those implications affect political messaging? What does this bifurcation mean for mainstream media? Is “mainstream” still an appropriate moniker for applying to the media outlets we intend to reference?</p>

<p>What does the ecology of dualing reality information ecosystems mean for political analysis? Don’t worry if you don’t know this either. I sure as sh$t don’t. But I expect it’s consideration would be integral. Full disclosure, I am admittedly biased … for I am obsessed with this information ecosystem quandary … as the frequency with which I pass out the following will attest:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dualing reality information ecosystems, worldview rigidity, and the power of propaganda may be considered the root problem from which we have birthed every crisis we now face. Solving it is prerequisite for progress … perhaps even prerequisite for halting our devolution.</p>— Moondeer (@kelleydawg) <a href="https://twitter.com/kelleydawg/status/1329184582839586816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

         	<p>Everyone keeps acting like Trump is a f$&amp;king mob boss controlling those around him. F$&amp;k that sh$t … he is the bullsh$t babbling baboon puffed up like an orange balloon that we all clearly see him to be. Trump is the f$&amp;king tool. His enablers built the propaganda machine for peddling this cult of personality as a means for safeguarding their minority rule over our nation.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure how we are meant to judge psychopathy where accountability is concerned, I can’t quite put my finger on a true psychopath’s capacity for comprehension. I have no such knowledge gaps when it comes to non-psychopaths utilizing weaponized psychopathy to achieve a stranglehold on power … willingly committing treason to protect that which they have gained.</p>

<p>The constitution had an answer for Trump. Enablers … such as Lindsey Graham …
publicly parted ways with any pretense of public service … liquidated their constitutional oathes when the Senate chamber was recast as a kangaroo court. They chose subversion.</p>

<p>When COVID broke like a rogue wave across this nation … they once again saw an opportunity to embrace the contemptible whilst scrambling to shore up their dwindling authority. These enablers sought to utilize the disruptive chaos produced by a plagued nation to amplify their efforts at disenfranchisement.</p>

<p>How pleased must they have been upon learning that the virus was disproportionately killing more brown and black Americans than it was killing white Americans. The virus … itself … became a tool. Those we speak of as minorities in this nation … those who when we add them together shall soon become a majority … they were the ones in the eye of the storm.</p>

<p>What perhaps began as a political stance born of stupidity or stubbornness or something else entirely … had blossomed into fresh opportunity … an opportunity for our  elderly white ruling class to roll back the color-to-white ratio of our populace … herd immunity very quickly became the official federal COVID response … tapping Atlas simply emboldened them to tell us so.</p>

<p>Lindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell, Bill Barr, every GD GOP senator, every f$&amp;king GOP member that has openly embraced these actions … or whose solidarity is shown through silence … these are the responsible parties. These are the people for which we must ensure accountability.</p>

<p>These are the vampiric vultures whose feathers we shall pluck … for WE THE PEOPLE must protect what we hold precious from such men and women … and make examples of them for future generations … examples we shall include in our lesson plans when teaching our children’s children the history of this nation’s Tree of Liberty.</p>

         	<p>What I thought was a tipping point for movements of equality, I have come to recognize as a tipping point for minority rule over this nation.</p>

<p>Our demography has shifted past that point which triggers the old white regime to brazenly subvert American democracy in one last ditch effort at clinging to the power it has held for so many centuries.</p>

<p>This is not sustainable. Our nation must be safeguarded against minority rule.</p>

<p>The shape of this effort, of the magnitude of this challenge, and the inevitability of a positive outcome … all such shapes remain obscured as the shadows of too many moving parts mingle and mate like shadow dancers projected upon the wall of Plato’s cave.</p>

         	<p>The general consensus across the Twittersphere with regard to Trump supporters goes like this: they are morons … Hillary was correct to call them deplorables … these are the dregs of our society.</p>

<p>Whole lotta truth here. The problem falling by the wayside for a myriad of reasons is that the percentage of people for which this provides an accurate description and the percentage of people that fall under the label “Trump supporter” are divergent.</p>

<p>What we must understand … and work to eliminate … is the why. For some f$&amp;king reason … too many f$&amp;king people are squaring their perceived reality with an acceptance that our societal dregs have blossomed into 49% of our populace. I am still not sure how they are squaring the ease with which millions in this nation have found it totally f$&amp;king plausible for there to be a shadowy, high power cabal drinking up babies in pursuit of immortality.</p>

<p>The degradation of journalistic credibility, the rise of outright like-you-learned-it-in-school propaganda being fed to our nation like news (but let off the hook as entertainment), the degree to which social media has supplanted traditional news in our information ecosystem, the bifurcation of our information ecosystem into two unbridgeable dualing reality echo chambers … these things are what one needs to spark the dumpster fire within which we find ourselves.</p>

<p>I can count on two hands the number of people I have come across with appreciation for this. The hand count drops to one when we refine our set to include people who realize that this ecosystem must be deconstructed should we hope to regain the ground we have lost … to perhaps progress further than we have previously been. Those within reach must be deprogrammed. Those unreachable must be drowned out.</p>

<p>I haven’t yet found a single soul interested in helping me work out how this might be achieved. How we might merge our echo chambers so that we might once again share a collective voice. There must be a return to civil discourse or the fabric of our society shall unravel past the point of patching. We must all inhabit a common reality should we ever hope to find common ground. The rage is properly placed but progress would require more of us … and … at the very least … it will certainly require we understand how the fire started.</p>

         	<p>A sorted affair, like the little girl&rsquo;s hair<br>
A libation on information<br>
When you can trust nothing you&rsquo;ll believe anything<br>
Conscious or conscientious? Which? Either?<br>
Break like summer sun through cloudy sky<br>
Or milky puss through broken sty</p>

<p>Wary should we be<br>
That our eyes don&rsquo;t paint the leaves<br>
Here there be monsters<br>
The likes of which I&rsquo;ve never seen<br>
Shimmy up and down the stalk<br>
So I may tell you what you&rsquo;ve seen</p>

<p>We breathe, we breed, we need to explain<br>
Awake we frighten fosterlings<br>
Adjudicate accessibility<br>
Drown out objectivity<br>
Bleating axioms angrily<br>
To taint with torpid movement the last of man&rsquo;s humanity<br>
The earthworm eats the shit we leave and<br>
Gives it back for us to seed<br>
Who ingests our karmic waste<br>
The kids may play like a snow day<br>
Constructing existential effigies<br>
But, the fires won&rsquo;t go out and now<br>
It&rsquo;s getting difficult to breathe</p>

Alone from earth to sky<br>

A gap in the trodden mind<br>

A witness to the quickness with which<br>

With cankered flesh and molten minds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A barren branch of rotted pine<br>
Like a faulty-bearing prisoner<br>

<p>Imprisoned by our own existence<br>

A pigeon on the tightrope<br>

Surpassing but a baby&rsquo;s whim<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meager keg of cream<br>
Nothing is scared from within our loans<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing sacred in our voice<br>
Dream your dreams<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dream of dreaming dreams</p>
